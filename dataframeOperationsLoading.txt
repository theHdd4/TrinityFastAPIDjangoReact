Potential Causes of Slow DataFrame Loading (>20–25MB)
===================================================

- Entire files are parsed into memory at once, leading to high memory pressure and slow garbage collection.
- CSV or Excel formats are used, requiring expensive string parsing instead of binary columnar formats.
- Data types are inferred on every load; wide datasets trigger repeated type conversions and object allocations.
- UI threads perform synchronous parsing, blocking the browser while large payloads are processed.
- Large results are transferred from server to client without pagination or streaming, causing network bottlenecks.
- Repeated serialization between Python, JavaScript, and storage layers creates excessive copying.

Performance Improvement Plan
============================

1. **Adopt Columnar Formats**
   - Use Apache Parquet or Arrow for uploads and intermediate storage. They load faster and reduce memory footprint.

2. **Stream and Chunk Large Files**
   - Read CSV/Excel files in chunks (`chunksize` with pandas or streaming parsers) and process incrementally.
   - Upload files using chunked HTTP requests to avoid buffering entire files in memory.

3. **Optimize Data Types**
   - Provide explicit `dtype` maps and convert high‑cardinality strings to categoricals.
   - Drop unused columns early to reduce transfer and processing time.

4. **Offload Heavy Work to the Backend**
   - Execute joins, filters, and aggregations server‑side with optimized libraries (e.g., Polars, PyArrow, or Dask).
   - Expose only paginated or summarized results to the client.

5. **Parallelize and Vectorize**
   - Enable multi‑core execution via libraries that release the GIL or leverage SIMD instructions.
   - Replace Python loops with vectorized operations or compiled UDFs (Numba, Cython).

6. **Leverage Caching and Reuse**
   - Cache parsed schemas and commonly used query results.
   - Memoize expensive transformations when inputs are unchanged.

7. **Use Web Workers or Async Tasks**
   - Move client‑side parsing into Web Workers so the UI remains responsive.
   - For server tasks, enqueue long‑running jobs and poll for completion to prevent timeouts.

8. **Monitor and Profile**
   - Instrument load times and memory usage on both client and server.
   - Use profilers (cProfile, PySpy, Chrome Performance) to identify bottlenecks and verify improvements.

Implementing these strategies will make DataFrame loading robust for files well beyond 25MB and provide a smoother user experience.
