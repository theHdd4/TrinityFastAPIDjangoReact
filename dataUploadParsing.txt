The Data Upload & Validate atom accepts CSV and Excel (`.xls`/`.xlsx`) files. On
upload each file is read with pandas using `parse_dates=True` so that any date
columns retain their datetime type. Column names are normalised by trimming
whitespace, converting to lowercase and removing inner spaces while keeping
underscores. The resulting DataFrame is used to derive a schema and is then
stored as an Arrow file for the validator atom.

During validation the service checks that required columns are present and that
any configured range or periodicity rules pass. If validation succeeds the
Arrow version of the file is uploaded to MinIO so other atoms can read it later.
