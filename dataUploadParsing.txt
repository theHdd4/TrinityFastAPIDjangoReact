The Data Upload & Validate atom now expects Arrow (`.arrow`) files rather than
CSV or Excel. Each file is opened with `pyarrow.ipc.open_file` and converted to
a pandas DataFrame. Column names are normalised by stripping whitespace,
lowercasing and removing spaces while preserving underscores.

After loading the Arrow table, the base validation step ensures required
columns such as `SalesValue` and `Volume` exist. Template validators may enforce
additional business dimensions or date columns. When validation succeeds the
DataFrame is re-saved as an Arrow file and uploaded to MinIO for later
retrieval.
