The Data Upload & Validate atom accepts CSV (.csv) and Excel (.xlsx) files. Each
file is read into a pandas DataFrame using `read_csv` or `read_excel`. Column
names are normalised by stripping whitespace, converting to lowercase and
removing spaces while preserving underscores.

The base validation step checks that required columns such as `SalesValue` and
`Volume` exist. Template validators may enforce additional business dimensions
or date columns. Once validation succeeds the DataFrame is saved as an Apache
Arrow file using `pyarrow` and uploaded to MinIO for later retrieval.
