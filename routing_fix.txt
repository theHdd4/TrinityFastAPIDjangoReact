1. Update `TrinityBackendDjango/.env` with the following variables:
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS=*` to accept requests from any domain.
   - `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com` so Django accepts form posts when proxied through Cloudflare.
2. Rebuild and start the stack:
   ```bash
   cd TrinityBackendDjango
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
3. Configure your Cloudflare tunnel to point to the frontend container on port `8080`.
4. Ensure the backend is reachable from the frontend using the same domain in your `.env` files (e.g. update `FRONTEND_URL`).
5. After restarting the containers, you should be able to log in and add users or clients from any IP address via the tunneled domain.
