If Docker Compose hangs during the `frontend` build with the message
"resolving provenance for metadata file" you can add more verbose output
and inspect where it stops.

1. Run the build in plain progress mode:
   ```
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose build frontend --progress=plain
   ```
   This prints each command in the Dockerfile so you can see exactly which
   step is executing.

2. The `TrinityFrontend/Dockerfile` now outputs log messages while installing
   dependencies and building the app. Look for the `[frontend]` prefix to
   identify when those steps start and finish. If the build hangs before the
   "dependencies installed" line, the `npm install` step is likely having
   trouble (check network connectivity to the npm registry).

3. If the hang occurs after the build completes, try disabling provenance
   generation by setting the environment variable:
   ```
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker compose build frontend --progress=plain \
     --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 --no-provenance
   ```
   This skips the metadata phase which can occasionally stall with some
   Docker versions.

4. For persistent issues, you can manually run the Dockerfile commands to
   narrow down the problem:
   ```
   docker build -t frontend-test TrinityFrontend --progress=plain --no-cache
   ```
