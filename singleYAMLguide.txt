The Trinity stack now uses a single docker-compose.yml with production ports. Run the services with:

```
docker compose up --build
```

Traefik listens on port 9080 and routes traffic from the Cloudflare tunnel at
https://trinity.quantmatrixai.com to the correct containers:

- `/admin/` -> Django on port 8000
- `/api/` -> FastAPI on port 8001
- `/` -> React frontend on port 8080

The `cloudflared` compose file under `cloudflared/` joins the `trinity-net`
network and forwards the domain to Traefik. Start it separately after the stack
is running:

```
cd cloudflared
docker compose up -d
```
