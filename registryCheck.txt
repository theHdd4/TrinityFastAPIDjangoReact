The environment registry tracks per-tenant variables inside the ``registry_environment`` table in Postgres.
Whenever an app or project is created, updated or deleted the Django ``registry`` app sends a signal that
calls ``DataStorageRetrieval.db.environment`` helpers. These helpers insert, update or delete rows so that
``client_name``, ``app_name`` and ``project_name`` always map to the latest identifiers, measures and
dimensions defined for that project.

Environment variables for a tenant are first looked up in the ``UserEnvironmentVariable`` table. If they are
not found there, ``get_env_vars`` (in ``TrinityBackendFastAPI/app/core/utils.py``) queries ``registry_environment``
so all services can share the same fallback values.

The ``registry_environment`` table is created by Django migrations. When new
tenants are added run ``migrate_schemas`` so the ``registry`` app creates the
table inside that tenant schema alongside ``registry_app`` and the other
registry tables. Once the table exists, projects can immediately store
identifiers, measures and dimensions for later use.

To inspect the saved records, open pgAdmin and connect to the ``postgres`` service defined in
``docker-compose.yml``. Browse to the ``registry_environment`` table and view its contents. Newly created
projects should appear automatically and renaming or deleting a project updates the corresponding entry.
