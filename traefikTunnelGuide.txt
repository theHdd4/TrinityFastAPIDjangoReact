# Cloudflare Tunnel with Traefik

This project exposes the React frontend to the public and keeps the backend services private. Cloudflare Tunnel forwards `https://trinity.quantmatrixai.com` into the Docker network. Traefik receives all requests and routes them by path:
* `/` → React frontend
* `/admin/` → Django (container `web:8000`, Traefik strips `/admin`)
* `/api/` → FastAPI (container `fastapi:8001`)

## 1. Install `cloudflared`
1. Sign in to your Cloudflare account and add the desired domain.
2. Install the tunnel client on the host:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
   sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
   cloudflared login
   ```
   Authentication stores credentials under `~/.cloudflared`.

## 2. Create a tunnel
```bash
cloudflared tunnel create trinity-frontend
```
Copy the generated `<UUID>.json` (for this project it is `e0a883c4-bc43-4742-b47a-96ef902e6bb3.json`) and `cert.pem` into `tunnelCreds/`. Use the UUID in `tunnelCreds/config.yml`.

## 3. Configure DNS
Create a single DNS record for the frontend:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns trinity-frontend trinity.quantmatrixai.com
```
Ensure the record is **Proxied** in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## 4. Docker Compose
`TrinityBackendDjango/docker-compose.yml` provides the backend services and the
Traefik reverse proxy. The Cloudflare tunnel now runs separately using the
compose file in the `cloudflared/` directory. The tunnel forwards all traffic
for `trinity.quantmatrixai.com` to Traefik (`service: http://traefik:80`).
Traefik then routes `/`, `/admin/` and `/api/` to the appropriate containers.

Traefik requires access to the Docker socket to read the labels. The compose file mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` into the Traefik container.

Start the backend stack from the `TrinityBackendDjango` directory so the
`trinity-net` network is created:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Then launch the tunnel separately:
```bash
cd ../cloudflared
docker compose up -d
```
Once the containers report "Connected" you can reach:
- `https://trinity.quantmatrixai.com` – React frontend
- `https://trinity.quantmatrixai.com/admin/` – Django admin
- `https://trinity.quantmatrixai.com/api/` – FastAPI

The other services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, MinIO, etc.) remain accessible only inside the Docker network and through the codebase.

## 5. Troubleshooting
- Confirm the `cloudflared` container logs show `Connected`.
- Verify the DNS records are proxied and reference the same tunnel ID as `config.yml`.
- Check `docker compose logs traefik` to inspect routing if the admin or API endpoints fail.
- A `502` on `/api/` usually means Traefik cannot reach the FastAPI container.
  Verify the label `traefik.http.services.fastapi.loadbalancer.server.port=8001`
  exists in `docker-compose.yml` and that the container is running. Also ensure
  `FASTAPI_CORS_ORIGINS` includes `https://trinity.quantmatrixai.com` so CORS
  preflights succeed.
