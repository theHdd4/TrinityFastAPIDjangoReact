After running validations, files that pass are uploaded to the MinIO bucket defined by the `MINIO_BUCKET` environment variable. The connection details (`MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`) are supplied by Docker Compose when the FastAPI service starts. By default the bucket name is `trinity`.
Uploads are organized in the following folder structure:

```
<client-name>/<app-name>/<project-name>/<timestamp>_<filename>
```

Client, app and project names come from the environment variables `CLIENT_NAME`, `APP_NAME` and `PROJECT_NAME`. These are set in `.env.dev` for local development and passed to the backend container.

Files appear in MinIO under:

```
<bucket>/<client-name>/<app-name>/<project-name>/
```

Each uploaded filename is prefixed with a timestamp so the path is easy to verify from the MinIO console.

To verify an upload using the MinIO CLI:

```
mc ls MINIO/trinity/my_client/my_app/my_project/
```

Or open the MinIO web console at `http://<minio-host>:9001` and navigate through the bucket folders.
