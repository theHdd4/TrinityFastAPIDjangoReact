After running validations, files that pass are uploaded to the MinIO bucket defined by the `MINIO_BUCKET` environment variable. The connection details (`MINIO_ENDPOINT`, `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`) are supplied by Docker Compose when the FastAPI service starts. By default the bucket name is `trinity`.
Uploads are organized in the following folder structure:

```
<client-name>/<app-name>/<project-name>/<timestamp>_<filename>
```

Client, app and project names normally come from the environment variables `CLIENT_NAME`, `APP_NAME` and `PROJECT_NAME`. When the `USER_ID` and `PROJECT_ID` variables are provided, the backend queries PostgreSQL to resolve the client and app names for that user and project. If the lookup fails the environment values are used instead.

Files appear in MinIO under:

```
<bucket>/<client-name>/<app-name>/<project-name>/
```

Each uploaded filename is prefixed with a timestamp so the path is easy to verify from the MinIO console.

To verify an upload using the MinIO CLI:

```
mc ls MINIO/trinity/my_client/my_app/my_project/
```

Or open the MinIO web console at `http://<minio-host>:9001` and navigate through the bucket folders.
