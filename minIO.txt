After running validations, files that pass are uploaded to the MinIO bucket defined in `TrinityBackendFastAPI/app/features/data_upload_validate/app/routes.py`.
Uploads are organized in the following folder structure:

```
<client-name>/<app-name>/<project-name>/<timestamp>_<filename>
```

Client, app and project names come from the environment variables `CLIENT_NAME`, `APP_NAME` and `PROJECT_NAME`. These are set in `.env.dev` for local development and passed to the backend container.

To verify an upload using the MinIO CLI:

```
mc ls MINIO/validated-d1/my_client/my_app/my_project/
```

Or open the MinIO web console at `http://<minio-host>:9001` and navigate through the bucket folders.
