Exhibition & Laboratory CORS Diagnostics
=======================================

Summary
-------
The exhibition layout save request and laboratory card creation were both failing
in browsers hosted on port 8080/8081. The FastAPI service only whitelisted a
static list of origins, so any new host/IP combinations (for example
192.168.1.7:8080) were rejected before they reached the application layer. The
layout save failure also surfaced a MongoDB authentication error once the
request bypassed the browser, while laboratory card creation returned a
Pydantic validation error because alias configuration was still written for
pydantic v1.

Key Findings
------------
1. ``app/main.py`` built ``allow_origins`` once at startup and never permitted
   dynamic :8080/:8081 hosts discovered at runtime. Browsers therefore dropped
   the preflight response with the "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header"
   error for /api/exhibition/layout and downstream laboratory calls.
2. The laboratory models still relied on ``allow_population_by_field_name``
   (a pydantic v1 setting). In pydantic v2 this flag is ignored, so the JSON
   response emitted snake_case keys and FastAPI raised
   ``LaboratoryAtomResponse.atomId field required`` during response validation.
3. Front-end logs only reported "Failed to fetch" making it difficult to match
   failed requests with their backend counterparts.

Fixes Applied
-------------
* Added ``FASTAPI_CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX`` support with a default
  ``https?://[^/]+:(8080|8081)$`` pattern so any :8080/:8081 origin authorised
  by docker-compose (or the HOST_IP override) is automatically accepted by the
  CORS middleware. The configuration is now emitted to the ``uvicorn.error``
  logger for easier runtime inspection.
* Migrated laboratory and exhibition pydantic models to the v2 ``ConfigDict``
  API and replaced deprecated ``.dict`` calls with ``model_dump``. This aligns
  request/response aliases with the field definitions so ``atomId`` is returned
  correctly.
* Instrumented the React helpers so the browser console logs every exhibition
  and laboratory API request (including URL, method and origin) and reports the
  exact HTTP status whenever the backend rejects a call. The global API helper
  also prints the resolved backend origins on start-up to simplify debugging
  future CORS mismatches.

Validation
----------
* FastAPI now prints the configured origins/regex at boot.
* Browser logs surface both the outbound URLs and HTTP status codes for
  exhibition layout saves and laboratory card creation, making CORS triage far
  quicker.
