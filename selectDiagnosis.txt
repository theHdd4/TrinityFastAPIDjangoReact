Issue: Combination dropdown showed `combo-online` and `combo-retail` because `_models_for_file` fell back to hard-coded demo records whenever a MinIO model-results Arrow file did not match the static demo key.
Resolution: Combination IDs, saved status, and per-model analytics now load exclusively from the MinIO Arrow file. When a file cannot be read or lacks the required columns, the API surfaces a "model data not available" note instead of injecting demo data.
Hardcoded/Fallback: No demo data remains in the select atom; requests without accessible MinIO content return empty results with explanatory notes so the UI can communicate that model data is unavailable.
