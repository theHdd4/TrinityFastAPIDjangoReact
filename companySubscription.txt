The Django backend now exposes a subscriptions app to store company metadata and
plan limits. Two models are available:

* **Company** – linked one-to-one with each tenant; holds optional metadata.
* **SubscriptionPlan** – records allowed seats, project cap and renewal date
  for a company.

Viewsets under `apps.subscriptions` provide CRUD endpoints at
`/api/subscriptions/companies/` and `/api/subscriptions/subscription-plans/`.
During tenant creation the `TenantSerializer` checks for `seats_allowed` and
`project_cap` fields and automatically creates a Company with a default plan.

To verify:
1. Start the backend with `docker-compose up --build`.
2. Create a tenant including `seats_allowed` and `project_cap`.
3. Run `curl http://localhost:8000/api/subscriptions/companies/` to see the
   created Company and plan.
