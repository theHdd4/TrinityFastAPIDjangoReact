# Mongo Express Usage Guide

Mongo Express provides a web interface for inspecting your MongoDB databases.
Both the development and production stacks include a `mongo-express` service
that connects to the `mongo` container.

## Accessing the UI
- **Production**: `http://localhost:8082`
- **Development**: `http://localhost:8083`

Log in with the credentials `admin`/`admin`.
These are configured via the `ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME` and
`ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD` variables in the compose files.

## Browsing databases and collections
After logging in you will see the list of databases on the left sidebar.
The application stores data in the `validator_atoms_db` database
(`feature_overview_db` contains results for the feature overview screens).
Expand the desired database to see all available collections.

Click a collection name to view documents. Use the **Query** box at the top of
 the page to filter results with standard MongoDB query syntax, for example:
```json
{ "user": "alice" }
```
The **Add Document** button lets you insert JSON directly.

Mongo Express communicates directly with MongoDB so any changes you make are
immediately reflected in the running containers.
