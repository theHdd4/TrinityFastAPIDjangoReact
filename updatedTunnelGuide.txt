# Separate Cloudflare Tunnels Setup

The project now expects three individual Cloudflare tunnels so each service is reachable on its own subdomain:

- **trinity.quantmatrixai.com** → React frontend
- **admin.quantmatrixai.com** → Django admin
- **api.quantmatrixai.com** → FastAPI backend

Follow the steps below on your host machine.

## 1. Install `cloudflared`
1. Create or sign in to your Cloudflare account and add the `quantmatrixai.com` domain.
2. Install the Cloudflare Tunnel client:
   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
   sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb
   cloudflared login
   ```
   Authentication places credentials under `~/.cloudflared`.

## 2. Create three tunnels
Create a tunnel for each service and record the generated UUID:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel create trinity-frontend
cloudflared tunnel create trinity-admin
cloudflared tunnel create trinity-api
```
Copy the corresponding `<UUID>.json` files and `cert.pem` into `tunnelCreds/`.
Three example config files (`config_frontend.yml`, `config_admin.yml`, `config_api.yml`) are provided. Replace `TUNNEL_ID_*` with the real IDs in each file.

## 3. Configure DNS
Point the subdomains to their respective tunnels:
```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns trinity-frontend trinity.quantmatrixai.com
cloudflared tunnel route dns trinity-admin admin.quantmatrixai.com
cloudflared tunnel route dns trinity-api api.quantmatrixai.com
```
Ensure the records are **Proxied** (orange cloud) in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## 4. Docker Compose services
The `docker-compose.yml` inside `TrinityBackendDjango` defines three `cloudflared-*` services. They mount `tunnelCreds` and run with their dedicated config files. Build and start the stack:
```bash
cd TrinityBackendDjango
docker-compose up --build
```
Each tunnel container should report `Connected` shortly after startup.

## 5. Validate connectivity
Short‑lived `check-*` containers automatically run a script verifying that each public URL responds:
```bash
docker-compose logs check-admin
docker-compose logs check-frontend
docker-compose logs check-api
```
You can run the helpers manually from the repository root:
```bash
python scripts/check_django_tunnel.py
python scripts/check_frontend_tunnel.py
python scripts/check_fastapi_tunnel.py
```
All commands should print `SUCCESS` when the tunnels and services are working.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If a script prints a **530** status the tunnel is not connected to your
containers. Common causes are:

1. The credentials JSON file does not match the `tunnel:` ID in the config
   (`config_admin.yml`, `config_frontend.yml`, or `config_api.yml`). Ensure the
   file name is `<UUID>.json` and that the same UUID appears in the `tunnel:`
   field of the config.
2. DNS records may be missing or not proxied. Verify the `cloudflared tunnel`
   `route dns` commands completed successfully and that the orange cloud is
   enabled in the Cloudflare dashboard.
3. The origin containers might not be running. Check the logs with
   `docker-compose logs web fastapi frontend` and confirm the `cloudflared-*`
   containers show `Connected`.

After correcting any issues restart the tunnel service:

```bash
docker-compose restart cloudflared-admin cloudflared-frontend cloudflared-api
```

Once the logs show **Connected** re-run the check scripts.
