# Django Backend Tunnel Validation

Run the `scripts/check_django_tunnel.py` helper to confirm the admin interface
is reachable through the Cloudflare tunnel:

```bash
python scripts/check_django_tunnel.py
```

The script prints the HTTP status and `Server` header. A typical successful
check looks like this:

```
Checking https://trinity.quantmatrixai.com/admin/login/
Status 200
Server cloudflare
```

If you receive a 4xx or 5xx status, verify the URL and inspect the tunnel logs
with `docker-compose logs cloudflared`. Errors such as `unexpected EOF` indicate
the tunnel dropped and should be restarted.
