# Dimension Mapping Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `/api/feature-overview/dimension_mapping`

Send a POST request with JSON payload containing the names used for the project:

```json
{
  "client_name": "ACME",
  "app_name": "Orders",
  "project_name": "Revenue"
}
```

The server will log each step while resolving the environment, loading from
Redis, and falling back to MongoDB. The lookup key is constructed as
`<client_name>/<app_name>/<project_name>/column_classifier_config`.

When saving a configuration via `/api/column-classifier/save_config`, the same
names are required. The backend will fetch the full set of environment
variables using these names, store them together with the identifiers, measures
and dimensions, and cache the result in Redis under the same lookup key. The
document is persisted in the `column_classifier_configs` collection in MongoDB.

Example payload for `/api/column-classifier/save_config`:

```json
{
  "client_name": "ACME",
  "app_name": "Orders",
  "project_name": "Revenue",
  "identifiers": ["sku"],
  "measures": ["amount"],
  "dimensions": {
    "product": ["sku"],
    "finance": ["amount"]
  }
}
```

The backend resolves the environment variables and returns a JSON response
confirming the MongoDB save result.
