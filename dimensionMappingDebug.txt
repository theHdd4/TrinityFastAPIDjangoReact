# Dimension Mapping Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `/api/feature-overview/dimension_mapping`

Send a POST request with JSON payload containing the names used for the project:

```json
{
  "client_name": "ACME",
  "app_name": "Orders",
  "project_name": "Revenue"
}
```

The server will log each step while resolving the environment, loading from
Redis, and falling back to MongoDB. The lookup key is constructed as
`<client_name>/<app_name>/<project_name>/column_classifier_config`.
