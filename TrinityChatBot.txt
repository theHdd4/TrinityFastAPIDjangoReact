1. Ensure Docker and Node.js are installed on your machine.
2. Copy `TrinityBackendDjango/.env.example` to `.env` and `TrinityFrontend/.env.example` to `.env`.
   The frontend `.env` must include `VITE_TRINITY_AI_API=http://localhost:8002` when using docker-compose.
3. Build and start the backend services from the `TrinityBackendDjango` folder:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This launches PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, the Django API, FastAPI utilities and the Trinity AI service on port 8002.
4. In a separate terminal start the React frontend:

   ```bash
   cd TrinityFrontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
5. In Laboratory mode each card shows a small lightning icon. Click it to open
   the Trinity AI chat box and enter a prompt describing the atom you want.
   When the AI finds a matching atom it is dragged into the card automatically
   and the lightning icon becomes inactive. Reâ€‘enable it by removing all atoms
   from the card.
