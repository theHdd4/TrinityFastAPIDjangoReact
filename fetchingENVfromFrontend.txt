The frontend stores environment details (``CLIENT_NAME``, ``APP_NAME`` and
``PROJECT_NAME``) in ``localStorage`` after a user logs in or selects a
project.  Components such as the chat bots retrieve these values with
``localStorage.getItem('env')``.  If a ``CLIENT_NAME`` value is present it is
appended as a ``?client=`` query parameter when requesting
``/env`` from Trinity AI.

The AI backend uses this client name to derive the tenant schema via
``get_tenant_schema``.  It then queries ``registry_environment`` in the
appropriate schema and returns the result along with a debug object that
includes the host, port, schema, table and SQL used.  The React components log
this debug information to the browser console so you can see exactly which
schema was queried and the fetched values.
