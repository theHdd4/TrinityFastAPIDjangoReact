1. Ensure Django backend is running and listening on port 8000 by checking `docker-compose logs web` or hitting `http://localhost:8000/`.
2. Open browser dev tools Network tab and perform the Add Client request. Confirm the request URL exactly matches `http://localhost:8000/api/tenants/tenants/`.
3. If the request is blocked by CORS or network error, look for messages in the console. Verify frontend `.env` variables point to the backend host/port.
4. If the request shows a response but server logs are empty, inspect Docker logs using `docker-compose logs web` to make sure the request actually reaches Django. If not, check that the container exposes port 8000 and environment variables `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and CORS settings allow your origin.
5. Enable Django debug logging in `settings.py` by setting `LOGGING` or run the server with `--verbosity 3` to see incoming requests.
6. Use `curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tenants/tenants/ -d '{...}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'` from the host to test the endpoint directly and inspect the response.
7. Check browser dev tools for cookies and CSRF tokens if CSRF is enforced; ensure the request includes credentials and the `csrftoken` header.
8. If a 500 error occurs, run `docker-compose logs web` to view the traceback. 
   Common causes include:
   - **Outside public schema**: the request host matched a tenant domain so 
     `MainTenantMiddleware` switched schemas. Call the endpoint using the 
     public host (e.g. `localhost`) or wrap the view with `schema_context('public')`.
   - **Duplicate domain**: the provided domain already exists in `clients_domain`.
     Delete the existing entry or use a different domain.
   - **Missing migrations**: if auto schema creation is disabled the tenant 
     schema might be missing tables. Run `python manage.py migrate_schemas --shared`.
   Examine the stack trace for the exact exception to fix the issue before
   retrying from React.
