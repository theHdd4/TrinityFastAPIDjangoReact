1. Place your animated SVG file named `background.svg` in the `TrinityFrontend/public` directory. Files placed here are served from the web root, so the image will be available at `/background.svg`.
2. Start the frontend dev server with `npm run dev` inside `TrinityFrontend`.
3. Visit the login page. The entire screen now uses the SVG as its background via the `<img src="/background.svg">` element.
4. To update the animation later, replace `background.svg` with your new file in `TrinityFrontend/public` and refresh the browser.
