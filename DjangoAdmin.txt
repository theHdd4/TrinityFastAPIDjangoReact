Trinity Administrator Guide
==========================

1. **Start the backend services**
   From the repository root run:
   
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start_backend.sh
   ```

   This builds the containers and exposes the Django service at `http://<HOST_IP>:8000/`.
   Set `HOST_IP` in `TrinityBackendDjango/.env` to the address of your host machine.

   If you are running locally outside of Docker, install the Python
   dependencies first:

   ```bash
   pip install -r TrinityBackendDjango/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create the initial tenant and users**
   Once the containers are running execute:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python create_tenant.py
   ```

   The script creates the default tenant (`quant_matrix_ai`) and seeds login accounts.
   You will get an admin user called `admin_user` with password `admin` and a
   super admin `neo` with password `neo_the_one` along with role‑based users:

   - `editor_user` / `editor`
   - `viewer_user` / `viewer`

3. **Log in to the Trinity Administrator**
   Visit `http://<HOST_IP>:8000/admin/` in your browser and sign in with one
   of the credentials above. Use `neo` for full super admin access. The
   `admin_user` account demonstrates the Admin role while the other accounts
   show Editor and Viewer permissions.

   If you hit a *500 Internal Server Error* on the login page make sure the
   database is running and that migrations have been applied:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
   ```

   After migrating collect static files so CSS/JS assets load correctly:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

   Finally import the available FastAPI atoms so they appear under
   **Atoms → Atom** in the admin interface:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python manage.py sync_features
   ```

4. **Managing tenants**
   The admin interface exposes models for Users, Roles and Tenants. When adding
   extra domains be sure to update `ADDITIONAL_DOMAINS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
   in `TrinityBackendDjango/.env` so the login session is accepted from those hosts.

5. **Static Files**
   If the admin pages show missing CSS or JavaScript files, run:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

   This gathers all static assets into `staticfiles/` so they can be served by
   the built-in WhiteNoise middleware.
