The list of available dataframes in the Data Upload & Validate auxiliary menu is
built directly from the objects stored in MinIO. If a dataframe was deleted or
the MinIO bucket itself no longer exists, the filename can still appear in the
frontend list. To remove these entries:

1. Open the MinIO web console (usually `http://localhost:9001`) or use the MinIO
   CLI.
2. Locate the bucket defined by the `MINIO_BUCKET` environment variable
   (default `validated-d1`).
3. Delete the missing files or remove the bucket entirely.
4. Refresh the auxiliary menu in the frontend; the `/list_saved_dataframes`
   endpoint will no longer return the deleted objects.

If the bucket name was changed in your `.env` file but the old bucket remains on
 disk, you can delete it with:

```bash
mc rm --recursive --force MINIO/<old-bucket-name>
```

This clears out unavailable dataframes so they no longer show up in the menu.
