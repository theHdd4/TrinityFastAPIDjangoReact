Large file uploads (>300MB) fail with a 500 Internal Server Error.
The browser reports a CORS issue because the response lacks the
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, but the root cause is the server
exception during processing.

Smaller files from the same origin upload correctly, confirming CORS is
not the issue. The upload route currently reads each CSV entirely into
memory with Polars before writing Arrow bytes for MinIO, which can exceed
available RAM for very large datasets and cause the failure.

Reverting the permissive CORS changes restores the previous origin
configuration. To handle very large files, consider streaming parses with
`pl.scan_csv` or increasing server resources so the temporary DataFrame
and Arrow serialization fit in memory.
