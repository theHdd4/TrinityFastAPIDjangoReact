# Agent_chart_maker

Utilities for enhancing chart-related prompts and deciding chart options. This folder currently provides helper functions only and does not expose its own FastAPI server.

Use `llm1.py` as a reference for integrating the logic with other services or run it as a script to experiment with prompt enhancement. When executed it communicates with the Ollama LLM at `http://10.2.1.65:11434/api/chat`.
