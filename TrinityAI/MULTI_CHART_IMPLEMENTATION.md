# Multi-Chart Implementation for Chart Maker

## Overview

The chart maker has been enhanced to support both single and multiple chart configurations based on user context. The AI can now intelligently detect when users want multiple charts and generate appropriate configurations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **AI Intelligence for Multi-Chart Detection**

The AI now automatically detects when users want multiple charts by analyzing:

- **Keywords**: "2 charts", "multiple charts", "both charts", "chart 1 and chart 2", "compare", "side by side"
- **Context**: "one showing X, another showing Y", "first chart for A, second chart for B"
- **Numbers**: "2", "two", "both", "pair of charts"

### 2. **Dual Response Formats**

#### Single Chart Response (Existing)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "multiple_charts": false,
  "chart_json": {
    "chart_type": "bar",
    "traces": [...],
    "title": "Chart Title"
  }
}
```

#### Multiple Charts Response (New)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "multiple_charts": true,
  "number_of_charts": 2,
  "charts": [
    {
      "chart_id": "1",
      "title": "First Chart",
      "chart_type": "bar",
      "traces": [...]
    },
    {
      "chart_id": "2", 
      "title": "Second Chart",
      "chart_type": "line",
      "traces": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced AI Prompt**

The AI prompt now includes:
- Multi-chart detection rules
- Examples for both single and multiple charts
- Guidance on creating complementary chart configurations
- Instructions for using different chart types for different perspectives

### 4. **Backend Processing**

The chart maker agent now:
- Detects response type (single vs. multiple)
- Transforms both formats to backend-compatible structures
- Validates configurations appropriately
- Preserves all original AI response fields

### 5. **Frontend Integration**

The frontend now:
- Detects multiple chart responses
- Creates appropriate chart configurations
- Updates the chart maker interface for multiple charts
- Provides appropriate success messages and guidance
- Sets the `numberOfCharts` and `multipleCharts` flags

## Usage Examples

### Single Chart Request
```
User: "Create a bar chart showing sales by region"
AI: Generates single chart configuration
Frontend: Shows single chart interface
```

### Multiple Charts Request
```
User: "Create 2 charts: one showing sales by region, another showing revenue trend over time"
AI: Generates multiple chart configuration
Frontend: Shows 2-chart layout with both charts configured
```

### Context-Based Detection
```
User: "I want to compare performance - one chart for Q1 and another for Q2"
AI: Detects "compare" + "one...another" = multiple charts
Frontend: Configures 2 charts for comparison
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **AI Logic Updates** (`ai_logic.py`)
- Added multi-chart detection rules
- Enhanced prompt with examples for both formats
- Added intelligence for complementary chart types

### 2. **LLM Agent Updates** (`llm_chartmaker.py`)
- Added `_transform_multiple_charts_to_backend_format()` method
- Added `_transform_multiple_charts_to_frontend_format()` method
- Updated main process method to handle both formats
- Enhanced logging for multi-chart scenarios

### 3. **Frontend Updates** (`AtomAIChatBot.tsx`)
- Added detection for `multiple_charts` flag
- Enhanced chart configuration creation for multiple charts
- Updated success messages to handle both scenarios
- Added guidance for using 2-chart layout

## Benefits

### 1. **User Experience**
- Users can request multiple charts naturally
- AI understands context and creates complementary configurations
- Frontend automatically adapts to show appropriate layout

### 2. **Flexibility**
- Supports both single and multiple chart workflows
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Allows for complex chart combinations

### 3. **Intelligence**
- AI automatically detects user intent
- Creates complementary chart types (e.g., bar + line)
- Suggests appropriate use of 2-chart layout

## How It Works

### 1. **User Input Analysis**
```
User: "Create 2 charts showing different views of sales data"
AI: Analyzes keywords "2 charts", "different views" → Multiple charts needed
```

### 2. **AI Response Generation**
```
AI: Generates response with multiple_charts: true, charts array with 2 configurations
```

### 3. **Backend Processing**
```
Agent: Detects multiple_charts flag, transforms to backend format
```

### 4. **Frontend Configuration**
```
Frontend: Creates 2 chart configurations, sets numberOfCharts: 2, enables 2-chart layout
```

## Configuration Options

### Single Chart Mode
- Default behavior
- Single chart configuration
- Standard chart maker interface

### Multiple Charts Mode
- Triggered by AI detection
- 2 chart configurations
- Enhanced interface with chart switching
- Complementary chart types

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Dynamic Chart Count**
- Support for 3+ charts
- Adaptive layout based on chart count

### 2. **Chart Relationships**
- Linked chart interactions
- Shared data sources
- Cross-chart filtering

### 3. **Advanced Multi-Chart Types**
- Dashboard configurations
- Story-based chart sequences
- Comparative analysis layouts

## Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Single Chart Detection**
   - "Create a bar chart" → Single chart response
   - "Show sales data" → Single chart response

2. **Multiple Charts Detection**
   - "Create 2 charts" → Multiple charts response
   - "Compare Q1 and Q2" → Multiple charts response
   - "One for sales, another for revenue" → Multiple charts response

3. **Context Detection**
   - "I want both charts" → Multiple charts response
   - "Show me multiple views" → Multiple charts response

### Test Commands

```bash
# Test single chart
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chart-maker/chart" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Create a bar chart showing sales by region"}'

# Test multiple charts
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chart-maker/chart" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Create 2 charts: one showing sales by region, another showing revenue trend"}'
```

## Summary

The multi-chart implementation provides:

✅ **Intelligent Detection**: AI automatically detects when users want multiple charts
✅ **Dual Formats**: Supports both single and multiple chart responses
✅ **Seamless Integration**: Frontend automatically adapts to show appropriate layout
✅ **Enhanced UX**: Users can request complex chart combinations naturally
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing single chart functionality remains unchanged

This enhancement makes the chart maker more powerful and user-friendly, allowing users to create comprehensive data visualizations with multiple complementary charts through natural language requests.
