"""Placeholder script used during Docker build.

The previous version downloaded a SentenceTransformer model which pulled in the
PyTorch stack. To avoid heavy dependencies we now rely on a lightweight
TF‑IDF based approach that does not require any external models.  The Docker
build still invokes this script so it simply ensures the expected directory
exists.
