# Enhanced Column Printing and LLM-Driven File Selection

## Overview

The SmartMergeAgent has been enhanced to provide better visibility into the column extraction process and to rely entirely on the LLM for intelligent file selection, removing manual file name matching logic.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Column Printing

When loading arrow files, the agent now provides comprehensive information:

- **File Details**: Name, path, and format detection
- **Column Information**: Total count, column names, and data types
- **File Statistics**: Row count and file size
- **Visual Output**: Emoji-enhanced console output for better readability

#### Example Output:
```
üìÅ File: sales_data.arrow
üìä Columns (8): ['id', 'date', 'product_id', 'quantity', 'price', 'customer_id', 'region', 'status']
üìà Rows: 15420
üíæ Size: 2048576 bytes
----------------------------------------

üéØ SUMMARY: Loaded 5 files with columns:
  ‚Ä¢ sales_data.arrow: 8 columns
  ‚Ä¢ customer_data.arrow: 6 columns
  ‚Ä¢ product_data.arrow: 7 columns
  ‚Ä¢ inventory_data.arrow: 5 columns
  ‚Ä¢ transaction_data.arrow: 9 columns
==================================================
```

### 2. Removed Manual File Matching

The following functions have been removed:
- `_find_mentioned_files()` - No more regex-based file name extraction
- `_find_files_by_keywords()` - No more keyword-based fuzzy matching
- Manual file pattern detection in `_enhance_context_with_columns()`

### 3. LLM-Driven File Selection

The agent now provides all available files and columns to the LLM, allowing it to:

- **Intelligently analyze** user requests
- **Select appropriate files** based on context and description
- **Identify common columns** between selected files
- **Suggest merge configurations** without manual intervention

#### Context Enhancement:
```
--- AVAILABLE FILES AND COLUMNS ---
Here are all the files available for merging with their column information:
{
  "sales_data.arrow": ["id", "date", "product_id", "quantity", "price", "customer_id", "region", "status"],
  "customer_data.arrow": ["id", "name", "email", "phone", "address", "customer_id"],
  ...
}

--- INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLM ---
1. Analyze the user's request to identify which files they want to merge
2. Use the column information above to determine the best join columns
3. If the user's request is unclear, suggest appropriate files based on their description
4. Always verify that the suggested files exist in the available files list
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging and console output make it easier to troubleshoot file loading issues
2. **Improved LLM Performance**: The LLM has complete information about all available files and can make better decisions
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed complex regex and keyword matching logic
4. **More Reliable**: No more false positives from manual file name matching
5. **User Experience**: Users can see exactly what files are available and their structure

## Usage

The enhanced functionality works automatically when you initialize the SmartMergeAgent:

```python
from Agent_Merge.llm_merge import SmartMergeAgent

agent = SmartMergeAgent(
    api_url="your_api_url",
    model_name="your_model",
    bearer_token="your_token",
    minio_endpoint="your_minio_endpoint",
    access_key="your_access_key",
    secret_key="your_secret_key",
    bucket="your_bucket",
    prefix="your_prefix"
)

# Files are automatically loaded with enhanced column printing
# The LLM will handle file selection based on user requests
```

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify the enhanced functionality:

```bash
cd TrinityFastAPIDjangoReact/TrinityAI/Agent_Merge
python test_column_printing.py
```

## Migration Notes

If you were relying on the manual file matching functions:
- The LLM will now handle all file selection logic
- Ensure your LLM prompts are clear about which files to merge
- The agent will provide comprehensive file information to help the LLM make decisions

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- Implement column type validation
- Add file size and row count limits
- Enhanced error handling for corrupted files
