# Environment Setup Guide

This repository uses a base `docker-compose.yml` without host port mappings.
Each environment provides its own override file with port assignments.

## Development
Run:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p trinity_dev up --build
```

## Production
Run:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p trinity_prod up --build
```

Use different project names (`-p`) to run multiple environments simultaneously.
