Project Rename Regression Tests
===============================

The regression tests for the project rename workflow live in
``TrinityBackendDjango/tests/test_project_rename_mongo.py``. They exercise the
MongoDB document rewrite helper that keeps column classifier and other cached
project resources in sync when a project name changes.

Prerequisites
-------------
* Python 3.10+ with the Django and pytest dependencies installed. The quickest
  way is to reuse the existing backend virtual environment or install the
  backend requirements with::

      pip install -r TrinityBackendDjango/requirements.txt

* No external services are requiredâ€”the test fakes MongoDB and Redis clients, so
  it can be run entirely offline.

Running the focused regression test
-----------------------------------
From the repository root run::

    pytest TrinityBackendDjango/tests/test_project_rename_mongo.py

Running the full backend test suite
-----------------------------------
To run every Django backend test (including the rename regression), execute::

    pytest TrinityBackendDjango/tests

Both commands must be executed from the repository root so pytest can discover
and configure the Django settings module automatically.
